            Anime (Japanese: アニメ) is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. 
            
            In Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. 
            
            However, outside of Japan and in English, anime is colloquial for Japanese animation and refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.
            
            Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is referred to as

            The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917.

            Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. 
            
            It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.

            Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots. 
            
            Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.
